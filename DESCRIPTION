Description: An estimation of a functional group's Fmsy in Atlantis ecosystem 
    model in R. It iteratively searchs for Fmsy of a specified functional group
    in a calibrated Atlantis model. The iterative simulations protocole was 
    defined by Dr. Elisabeth Fulton (CSIRO) for the IndiSeas project
    (http://www.indiseas.org/, 03/01/2018). It is designed first to gradualy 
    increase F for a particular functional group in the model up to the collapse 
    of the stock. Then, it narrows down the value of Fmsy (in y-1) with a 
    precision of 10E-02. To do so, it copies/pastes all the files necessary to 
    run the calibrated model into a seperate directory and then modifies the 
    fishing mortality parameter (mFC) of the selected functinoal group in the 
    harvest parameters file within this directory before each simulation. A new 
    name is provided for the output files in the bach/shell file and finally the 
    Atlantis model is run. It starts at F = 0 , with a step of F = 0.4, until 
    reaching collapse (NEED TO BE MODIFY AS B = 0.1*B0).  Then in the interval 
    containing FMSY, reduce F-step by 50% progressively until a sufficiently 
    smooth curve is obtained to enable estimation of FMSY at a precision of 
    10E-02.For each simulation allow a burn in time of at least 20 years 
    (depends on the time that your model needs to stabilize), then run for 
    another 30 years, and take average of the last 5 years to estimates the 
    yield.
